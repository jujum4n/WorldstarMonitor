Worldst▲r Monitor - Bet▲ - By: juju
===========================

##Description:
This Cryptocurrency Monitor is a peice of software which utilizes various RESTAPI calls to display and calculate market data from various Bitcoin Websites (Coinbase, Cryptsy, BTC-E, Blockchain.info) 

The reason this project started was out of laziness, I grew tired of looking at multiple websites as well as using calculators and copying and pasting values from web-pages.

The market Data page helped me quickly look at what my "portfolio" is at, as well as quickly viewing Buy/Sell data on Cryptsy and other Bitcoin Prices/Market data from Coinbase and btc-e and Blockchain.info. 

The Mining tools page can also create mining statements and helps manage launching the mining commands when yuou would have possibly had a bunch of batch files in the past. 

The Address storage page acts as a place to paste strings, so you dont have to open your wallets or go to other sites to get at your various currency addresses.

This project was done using only C# Visual Studio .NET Libraries coupled with a few other open source libraries, I created a Cryptocurrency Monitor. It mainly has been used to calculate profits/losses for myself. It enabled me to view several websites data all at once and to monitor the worth of my portfolio.

##Notes:
I am going to be updating the structure and some of the other aspects of the code to be a bit more friendly for others to contribute. If anyone has any feature requests let me know, and I can see what I might be able to come up with.

Files needed along with the compiled exe inorder to run:
- RestSharp.dll - To expedite RESTAPI calls so I could get market data eaiser
- Newtonsoft.Json.dll - To unwrap the RESTAPI calls into objects eaiser.
- totallist.txt -  Input your total number of coins corresponding to the line position in coinlist.txt
- coinlist.txt - Do not edit this file, if you want a new coin added let me know and I can hook it up
- marketlist.txt - You can re-arrange the list of the order of the markets. Put your favorite markets ontop of this list and resafe the text file.

(Look in the ..\WorldstarMonitor\bin\Release\ for everything you would need to run the program)
